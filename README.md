# EN2533 - Robot Design and Competition
During the EN2553 Robot Design and Competition module, we ventured into the world of robotics, unveiling innovation and creativity. 💡🌐

🤖 Physical Robot:

We used mechanics and programming to build a robot that can follow lines, track walls, and solve challenging mazes. 🚀🏁🧩

🌐 Virtual Robot:

Our virtual robot smoothly maneuvered through different tasks. It was able to trace solid lines, dotted lines and tracking walls. 🎯🏞️

It has the ability to analyze chessboards, recognize pieces, and strategize for the king's checkmate move. And it secured the top spot, showcasing our virtual prowess! 🏆♟️
