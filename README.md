# EN2533 - Robot Design and Competition
 Semester 03 Robot Design Competition

 During the EN2553 Robot Design and Competition module, we ventured into the world of robotics, unveiling innovation and creativity. 

Physical Robot:

We used mechanics and programming to build a robot that can follow lines, track walls, and solve challenging mazes. 

Virtual Robot:

Our virtual robot smoothly maneuvered through different tasks. It was able to trace solid lines, dotted lines and tracking walls. 

It has the ability to analyze chessboards, recognize pieces, and strategize for the king's checkmate move. And it secured the top spot, showcasing our virtual prowess!
